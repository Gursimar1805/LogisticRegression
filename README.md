# LogisticRegression
# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, class, and more.  
It‚Äôs implemented in **Python** using popular data science libraries, with step-by-step data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

## üìå Dataset
The dataset used is the **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) containing passenger details such as:
- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
- Name, Gender, Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (`SibSp`)
- Number of parents/children aboard (`Parch`)
- Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarkation Port
- Survival Status (`Survived`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights using visualizations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features for better predictions.
- **Model Building**: Logistic Regression (can add more models if needed).
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
